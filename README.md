# riskofrain2-items
### Overview
Source code for INFO 1601 Project:\
[Risk of Rain 2 Items Website](https://riskofrain2-items.web.app/)


This website lets users browse the items of the popular game, Risk of Rain 2, while also allowing them to create
and store builds which are stored in the cloud per account. Anyone can browse the list of items and their descriptions,
however an account is required to create builds and add favorites. 

Builds can be easily modified and filters are available for easy identification of items.

This was our first major programming project, and also our first time developing something with HTML/CSS/JS beyond small scale lab assignments.
It was also our first time uploading a project to github so the commits are very goofy.

### Current Issues
- The icon for the build button is a dead image
- Website layout is not properly designed for mobile
